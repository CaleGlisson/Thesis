\chapter{Toolchain Issues \label{chap:Issues}}
While the toolchain should be used in the way described in the previous chapter, there are some issues that exist in the current implementation of the toolchain that will be outlined here.
\section{LLVM Compilation}
When running the python script, a number of errors that prevent compilation do come up. First, the LLVM compilation itself can fail due to a bug in the DSWP algorithm that causes loop headers to be used as exit blocks. One way to get around this is to adjust the ratio of hardware to software that is targeted in the DSWP algorithm.
